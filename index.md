## Profile: Between Software and Hardware

I am an embedded software engineer with experience in automotive and medical industries.
My role is firmware and driver development. I can make a good addition to a team in developing features in C, implementing drivers or making SRS.

Hill-rom creates a wide range of connected medical equipment from hospital beds to ICU peripherals.
I used to work on a therapy mattress project which required a ECU to drive motors and sensors in order
to manage airflow for pulmonary care mattress functions and to display various measurements on a TFT.
<BR />
I started working on this project during the COVID-19 crisis, right after waking up in a Hill-rom bed myself. I decided to move to Brittany specifically for this position. It was a very rewarding experience and an exceptional envrionment during peculiar circumstances.

## Academics and internships

Fun fact: I used to contemplate doing research and working in Academia during scool.
Which is why my most noteworthy internships were in labs.
There has been a change of plans, but you never know what the future might bring!

Below is a recap of those experiences:

LS2N is formerly known as IRCCyn which is the research lab on ECN campus. Linked to CNRS and INRIA, conducts research on software, robotics, data and control and probably other fields which my "hyppocampus" cannot process (_reference to totem animal_).
<BR />
The project I did revolves around the configuration and execution of [RTOS Trampoline](https://github.com/TrampolineRTOS/trampoline) on a ["RISCV"](https://github.com/riscv)
["platform"](https://github.com/ucb-bar/fpga-zynq)[Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com).

<strong>Language</strong> RISCV assembly, C, Verilog, some Scala
<BR />
<strong>Targets</strong> Zedboard: Zynq + ARM Cortex-A

My first internship aborad was with CAIRN team in IRISA, which focuses on High Performance computing architectures (CPU, GPUs), embedded hardware platforms, real-time systems and design tools. The research facility is located on the ENSSAT campus in the absolute center of the ideal breton town.
<BR />
My final year's project was about an FPGA Implementation of Real-Time Chaos-based secure
Encryption/Decryption Communication Systems. This required diving into symmetric cryptography based on DES and it allowed to have a hands on experience with FPGA.

<strong>Language</strong> VHDL

<strong>Targets</strong> Zynq-7030
